 ## 🏥 HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ##


 ****📌 Project Overview****

The ****Hospital Appointment and Management System**** is a comprehensive Oracle PL/SQL-based application designed to automate and streamline hospital operations. It addresses key challenges in appointment scheduling, medical records, billing, and staff/medication tracking to enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care.


***🚩 Problem Definition***

***odern hospitals face several inefficiencies, including:***

✅Poorly managed appointment scheduling systems

✅Unstructured and fragmented medical records

✅Complexities in insurance processing and billing

✅Limited automation in staff and medication inventory management



***🎯 Project Objectives***

This system aims to:

✅ Automate patient, staff, and appointment management

✅ Improve access to and tracking of medical records

✅ Streamline billing and insurance integration

✅ Manage medication prescriptions and inventory automatically

✅ Provide real-time views for better hospital decision-making


## PhaseII: Business Process Modeling (Related to Management Information Systems - MIS) ##

This BPMN diagram shows a healthcare workflow where a patient requests an appointment. If the doctor is unavailable, it's scheduled for later. If available, the patient is seen and a medical record is updated. The MIS system handles scheduling, consultations, and checks medication stock. If stock is available, the billing department generates a bill and processes payment. If not, the process ends. It involves patients, reception/nurses, the MIS system, and billing.

## PhaseIII: Logical Model Design ##

This diagram shows a hospital database structure with tables for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Medical Records, Billing, Insurance, Medications, Prescriptions, Departments, and Staff. Each patient can have insurance, appointments with doctors, medical records, bills, and prescriptions. Prescriptions link doctors, patients, and medications. Staff members belong to departments. The system is designed to track all hospital operations efficiently through these connected entities.

## PhaseVII: Advanced Database Programming and Auditing ##


## 1. Problem Statement DevelopmentProblem Statement: ##
The Hospital Appointment and Management System currently allows unrestricted data manipulation by employees, posing potential risks to data integrity, especially during off-business periods. To improve operational control and data security, the system requires enhanced database logic to automate rules enforcement and track user activity.

Justification for Advanced PL/SQL Features:
Triggers: Needed to automatically prevent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on weekdays and public holidays.

Packages: Useful for grouping related auditing procedures and functions to streamline logic, promote reusability, and centralize audit logic.

Auditing Mechanism: Essential to log sensitive changes (e.g., updates to patient records or billing info) and hold users accountable for actions taken in the system.

Restriction Rules to be Implemented:
Block any data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) by employees:

On weekdays (Monday to Friday)

On public holidays in the upcoming month

A static Holidays table will store these public holiday dates.
